## About Me

Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at University of California Berkeley, Mechanical Engineering. I am a part of the [ICON lab](https://iconlab.negarmehr.com/) where I am advised by Prof. [Negar Mehr](https://negarmehr.com/). My research interest lies in robot learning, with a particular focus on reinforcement learning, foundation models for robot learning, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.

During my PhD, I worked on [Honda Research Institute (HRI)](https://usa.honda-ri.com/) as a research intern, where I developed motion planning algorithm autonomous driving. Before joining UC Berkeley, I received my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering, from Seoul National University, South Korea. 

## Research Interests

- **Robot Learning:** Reinforcement learning for robot control and planning
- **Foundation Models:** Application of large-scale models in robot learning
- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Multi-agent reinforcement learning and coordination
- **Safe and Interacive Motion Planning:** Risk-sensitive and interaction-aware planning

## News

- **[Jul, 2025]** Our paper from Honda Research Institute "IANN-MPPI: Interaction-Aware Neural Network-Enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral Approach for Autonomous Driving" got accepted at the International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) 2025!
- **[May, 2025]** I am attending International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2025 at Atlanta to present our work "CurricuLLM: Automatic Task Curricula Design for Learning Complex Robot Skills using Large Language Models"!
- **[Apr, 2025]** Our paper "DDAT: Diffusion policies enforcing Dynamically Admissible robot Trajectories" got accepted at the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS), 2025!
